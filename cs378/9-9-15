Protocols
	framework for a class.
		has required and optional methods to be implemented

	A clasa adopts or conforms to a protocol
	when a class conforms to a protocol, all required methods must be implemented
	just like classes, protocols

	Why are protocols interesting?


Delegates
	What is delegation? What are delegates?
		deleagation is a simple and powerful pattern in which one object in a program acts on behalf of, or in coordination with, another object
		The delegating object keeps a reference to another object, the delegate, and at the appropriate time sends a message to it
			there is nothing that say youcan't have more than one delegate
		the main value of delegation is that it allows you to easily customize the behavior of several objects in one central object
		used etensively in normalios programming
		closely associated with protocols
		It's conceptually similar to the noion of call back functions
		theres's a bit of coupling going on.
