gensture recognizers
	a UIView, by virtue of being a UIReponder, is the central focus of touches.

	It would make sense, then, if every thoush were reported direcctly to the view in which it occurred; but this isn't the case since the OS dosn't see views, by only the entire app.

	As such, a touch is represented as a UITouch

	From the perspective of a view:
		a view can contain more than one gesture recognizer
			they are contained in a UIView property (an array) name gestureRecongizer
		However, just one gesture can occcur at any given time
	Types of gesture recognizers:
		Discrete:
		Continuous:
