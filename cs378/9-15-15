Storyboards
	Vie controllers in a storyboard car called scenes
	all scenes are stored in one file - storyboard
		previously, all UIs has seperate XIB files
			You can still use seperate XIB files, but most developers don't
	Benefits
		you can easily get a high-level conceptual overview of the application
		it shows you how the screens are related
		you get a sense of the slow of the application
	Scene
		a single view controller
		a view needs a view controller to manage it
	Segue
		A defined transition between scenes
Some history:
	in the beginning, there was just manually positioning all the ser interface elements
	then came springs and struts, which allowed you to define relationship between UI elements, among other things
	iOS 6 introduced Auto Layout, which introduced the concept of contraints
		We'll be focusing on contraints because they are foundational to UI design all by themselves, and are used with size classes
	iOS 8 brought Adaptive layout with sie classes
		this is enabled by default when creating a project and therefore why you see a square view in interface builder
		by default, the UI you design is used for all device sizes


Size Classes:
	Define an abstract notion of an iphone and ipad
	there are compact and regular sizes
	for vertical and horizonatla dimensions
	you define a base UI
		the variations for size
	Auto layout is all about contraints
		can be set in IB (typical methodology) and programmatically
			you can define contraints
	Demo


Alert Views:
	An easy was to display concise and informative information to the user
	UIAlertview and UIActionSheet are deprecated in iOS 8 and replaced by UIAlertController
	The kind of UI that is displayed ina UIAlertController (Alert, Action Sheet) is specified by the controller's preferred style when creating the controller
	You customize the UI by identifying what buttons or text fields you want to display

Primary classes:
	UIAlertController
