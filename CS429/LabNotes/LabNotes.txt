Assembler:

Converts Y86 assembly into byte code
Basically builds a memory map - Directives can modify that behavior
Y86 instruction set and addressing modes in the text book

Common directives
	.pos x: moves to address x in memory
	.align x: aligns to the next x byte boundary
	.long x: jump value x in the memory map
	label: named labels can replace raw addresses
