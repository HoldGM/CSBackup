Question 1:

A virtual address is a range of memory addresses that the OS makes available
to a process. 

Physical address is the actual address of the hardware memory installed in the
computer. 


The virtual address is mapped to a physical address when the 
memory is allocated in physical memory.

Question 2:

A memory exception is when there is some error in memory access, usually caused by a program not having enough memory available in the system to run properly. This can result in the process crashing or running very slowly.

Question 3:

Paging allows the system to move portions of a process's required memory allocaiton into physical memory without having to load the entire process into memory at the same time. This
eliminates external fragmentation by being able allocate all of physical memory in to page blocks. This also eliminates the limitation of memory needed to run a large process. 

Question 4:

Internal fragmentation is when a page section in memory is not fully utilized by a process.
We could reduce internal fragmentation by reducing the page size allocated to memory, this would mean that small processes will have less internal fragmentaiton.

Question 5:

A page fault occurs when a running process tries to access a memory page that is in virtual memory but not loaded into physical memory. 

If a page fault occurs the OS would try to make the page available in physical memory, if this is not possible for some reason the program would termnate due to a memory access error.
