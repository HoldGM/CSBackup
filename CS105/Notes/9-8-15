declaring
	type * name
	tpes is the data type pointed to by the pointer
	int *i, j //only i is pointer
	int *i, *j //both at pointers


Pointers
	precedence: & and * are the same as +, -, !
	*p++ // increments pointer after use
	*++p // increments pointers before use
	++*p // increments the dereferenced value of p before sue
	(*p)++ // increments dereferenced value after use


Stack vs Heap
	stack
		static Memory management
	heap
		dynamic memory management

Stack
	Pros
		fast access
		no need to deallocate
		memory efficient (usually consecutive)
	Cons
		limit on the size
		fixed size variables only
		variables have to be local

Heap
	Pros
		unlimited memory (well within limits)
		can be globally accessed
	Cons
		slower access
		potentially fragmented memory
		must be managed (you need to delete)
	Putting things on the heap
