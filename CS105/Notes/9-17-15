Virtual Functions

Classes
	if we want to use the underlying classes method(use virtual)
		is is called dynamic dispatch
	Allows objects to have many tpes
		enables the compiler to call the more specific type
	virtual void print(){}


Pure Virtual
	What the base class defines the method with no implementation.
		forced derived classes to procide the implementation
	virtual const string print() = 0;


Multiple inheritance
	c++ allows multple base classes
		class Studnet : public Person, public Academic
		Potentially messy
			if bot person and academic have the same member you must distinguish
			Person::x or Academic::X
		If both Person and Academic are both from a common class, yu get two instances of the common class (diamond problem)
	Coding practice says try to avoid unless really necessary (and you know what you are doing)


Friends
	Allows selected classes to access protected and private data
		class must declare its friends
		Declare them usually in the line after making your class
	Friend Functions
	Friend Classes

This operator
	Intances have access to their own address thorugh the keyword "this"
	"this" pointer passes as an implicit argument to every non-statuc member function
	It's a const pointer to the type of class (MyClass *const)
	Use like a pointer this->memberVariable, this->
